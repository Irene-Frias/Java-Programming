# Java-Programming (1st year of Cross-Platform Application Development)
Java exercises carried out for the subject of Cross-Platform Application Development at the I.E.S. Belén (Málaga). Most of the exercises in this repository are taken from the programming manual by 
[`Alfonso Jiménez Martín and Francisco Manuel Pérez Montes (ed. Paraninfo)`](https://www.paraninfo.es/catalogo/9788428342865/programacion-).

To start working it is necessary to have a development site where you can program.
In this case I will install the Java Plug-in.

- [`Apache NetBeans 19`](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/nb19/)
it a open source integrated development environment (IDE) that provides advanced tools for software development in Java and other programming languages.

- [`Oracle`](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) 
it is the one that helps you develop and deploy Java applications on desktops and servers.

- [`Java`](https://www.java.com/es/download/ie_manual.jsp)
in order to use this site it is necessary to have the Java Plug-in version 1.3.1.07 installed.

Also with the help of the notes on this page called [`Learn X in a Y minute`](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/java/).


## 📂 File structure
The exercises are divided by trimester. Within each quarter, they are separated by the manual units (listed below). Inside each drive folder is a Java project with several *packages*, numbered and named as follows:

- **Solved exercises:** already solved activities from the book, they are usually short practical exercises that serve to 
reinforce concepts that are covered in each unit. It is likely that the resolution of the program is different 
from the ones in the book. 

```
Solved exercises

│   ├── build/classes
│   ├── nbproject
│   ├── src/
│        ├── tarea*/
│   ├── build.xml
└──  manifest.mf
```

- **Proposed activity:** exercises that appear in the book, consist of practicing more of what was learned in each 
of the units.

```

- **Additional Activity:** they are exercises that do not fall into any of the previous categories and do not come from the manual, may be challenges presented in class or the student's own initiatives. Its function is to reinforce the contents worked on in the unit.

## 📚 Units
The topics covered during the course are listed below in each of the following sections.
### Unit 1 - Basic Concepts
Basic exercises to understand Java syntax, as well as other common concepts to understand any programming language. Variables, different types of operators, primitive types (sizes, ranges and conversions), console output and input, the java API and a brief introduction to methods.

### Unit 2 - Conditionals
This topic covers selection structures, nonlinear applications, single `if`, double `if-else`, and multiple `switch` conditionals. Extensive use of relational and logical operators, as well as revisiting the ternary operator.

### Unit 3 - Loops
This unit covers repetition structures `while`, `do while`, and `for`, as well as how to program applications that repeat sets of statements using loops. Has been made an extensive use of functions for the resolution of the exercises in order to not repeat code, although the functions will be explained in the next unit.

### Unit 4 - Functions
The concept of functions is introduced, along with their benefits and how to implement them in code. Exercises cover the use of parameters, automation, overloading and recursion. In addition, students will create their first libraries in Java.

### Unit 5 - Matrices
Arrays are used to manage multiple values ​​in a variable, exploring their creation, manipulation and common operations. Programs will be designed that modify the length of `arrays` at runtime without losing data, using the Java API to solve problems.

### Unit 6 - Strings
The primitive type `char` and the `String` class are studied, applying advanced methods for text manipulation. The Java API will be used to develop applications that process textual information efficiently.

### Unit 7 - Classes
The fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) are introduced, applying them in practical programs. We will work with attribute visibility and class design to improve code structure and functionality.
